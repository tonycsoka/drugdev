**Notes**

The flask app can be run as follows

`drugdev> export FLASK_APP=drugdev  
 drugdev> flask run`

Tests are run with pytest

`drugdev> pytest`

Celery task are run with the app in drugdev.tasks

`drugdev> celery beat -A drugdev.tasks.celery  
drugdev> celery worker -A drugdev.tasks.celery --loglevel=info`

Endpoits for the app are

`/api/contacts [GET] (List of contacts)  
/api/contact/<username|email> [GET, POST, PUT, DELETE] (get, post, put, delete a contact)`

data format for post/put is 

`{'email': 'jim@jim.com', 'surname': 'greeve', 'first_name': 'jim'}`

To add a second email, issue a put

`{'email': 'jim-2@jim.com'}`

**Extra Notes**

I initially ued Python 3.7, but Celery has issues with this due to using async as a module name.  I also ran into issues 
with using the latest redis library (3.0.1), and have to revert back to 2.10.6.  This is reflected in the requirements
